# WeShouldGetThisDomain-DoesJasonEverKnowWhatHesTalkingAbout-AndPreciselyCriticizeHisEntireCareer

> we should get a domain, like "DoesJasonEverKnowWhatHesTalkingAbout.com" and put our understanding and experience out there as a response to anything and everything hes ever produced, everything from PennAI that has bugs to this fking bullshit, all of his papers, his entire career -- i think we can have a lot of fun with this throughout our career and our lives

the front page will be like jason's CV and his educational bg: bs in biology (slacker major), then phd in human genetics (with a non-famous thesis advisor no one cares about) where he was a little bitch to an autoclave as per his thesis which is online (the table of contents are), never did a post doc in AI or ML or computational biology bc he was incredibly underqualified to do that, so he became self-taught, started producing work that would impress university administrators who didnt truly understand his work as being medicore, got some jobs, couldnt keep up with the field and the research, became a serious hater of anyone who got ahead of him, so that's his life story

and it'll be like our CVs ... and anytime we're bored, we'll find some bullshit he produced in his career and precisely take it apart and as the question: "does jason ever know what hes talking about?" and the other important question "did this need to be a paper or could it have just been a blog article no one read" and "why does this pathetic old man make so much noise when he doesnt know what hes talking about" and of course "when will he just shut the fk up"
