# WeShouldGetThisDomain-DoesJasonEverKnowWhatHesTalkingAbout-AndPreciselyCriticizeHisEntireCareer

![img](calling-it-as-i-see-it.png)

> we should get a domain, like "DoesJasonEverKnowWhatHesTalkingAbout.com" and put our understanding and experience out there as a response to anything and everything hes ever produced, everything from PennAI that has bugs to this fking bullshit, all of his papers, his entire career -- i think we can have a lot of fun with this throughout our career and our lives

the front page will be like jason's CV and his educational bg: bs in biology (slacker major), then phd in human genetics (with a non-famous thesis advisor no one cares about) where he was a little bitch to an autoclave as per his thesis which is online (the table of contents are), never did a post doc in AI or ML or computational biology bc he was incredibly underqualified to do that, so he became self-taught, started producing work that would impress university administrators who didnt truly understand his work as being medicore, got some jobs, couldnt keep up with the field and the research, became a serious hater of anyone who got ahead of him, so that's his life story

and it'll be like our CVs ... and anytime we're bored, we'll find some bullshit he produced in his career and precisely take it apart and as the question: "does jason ever know what hes talking about?" and the other important question "did this need to be a paper or could it have just been a blog article no one read" and "why does this pathetic old man make so much noise when he doesnt know what hes talking about" and of course "when will he just shut the fk up"

i saw that he put paul on his journal, biodata mining ... the one you go to where you dont get in to CNS LOL #4 is biodata mining it seems hahaha, and paul had serious issues understanding what i was saying or what the post-docs were saying during lunch so him reading papers from that journal is so funmy to me, obviously a chess move but for what reason tho

we should pour our experience, and creativity and all of our frustrations with these people in a creative outlet that warns people that this is whats out there, this is what happens if you are not qualified in your field you cause so much damage bc u dunno what youre doing, and it should warn universities to not hire people like jason, ever

LETS VIBE CODE A CLINICAL BIOINFORMATICS PIPELINE YAY WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG ... omg omg omg what is going on in the world ... absolute fking GARBAGE

# let's do this 2026
